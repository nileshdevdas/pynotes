Virtual Environment : 

1.  What is virtualenv 
    i am creating a python construct for myself 
	a) All the libraries that get installed are getting installed for me (Libs) 
	b) I can activate this environment and then pip install it does not install in the base 
		python(globla) but only gets installed in my project 
	c) What is the advantage 
		i) i wanted used request 1.0  however my other project cannot work wity 
			request 1.0 as they requests 2.3 and how will we be able to 
			manage this out 
		ii) i want different version of library for different projects 


2.  If a project person uses 10 libraries how his co-developers will come to know which 
	libaries are used in the project --> 
	we dont commit libraries to the project 
	we dont commit libraries to the scm 
	who rescues you here   (pip freeze --> requirements.txt ) 
	package.json composer or pom.xml config ---> 


3.  The Application dependencies are registered in the package.json and then then requirements.txt
	eventually   can be read 






There are 2 ways to create a virtual env 
a)  python -m venv  myapp1 
b)  pip install virtualenv 
	virtualenv  <yourproject> 


if you dont activate you venv then still it points to root 
How do i activate my Venv 

1.  pip install virtualenv 
2.  virtualenv  <yourproject> 
3.  cd  <yourproject>
4.  cd Scripts 
5.  activate.bat/.sh 
6.  cd ... 
7.  run pip freeze # and check 
8.  pip install requests 
9.  run pip freeze  # and chec


What happens if one person check in this code in the scm (Github) 
someelse wishes to install all the libraries  


From a project a---> a person does a commit --> push and there are mulitple people who are working 
on the project ---> then they would have ---> pull /clone ---> 
this means that i would need the activity --> to be completed ---> in the pull 

a)   First   virtualenv --> <projdir> 
b)        cd virtualenv\scripts\Activate 
c)       cd .. 
d)       pip install -r requirements.txt

def a(x, y) : 
     return x + y
