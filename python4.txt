TDD 
	Test Driven Development 
	1.  Coverage 
		Mines : Code Mines : 
		a code whihc is not tested is quliefier for mine 
		When code test it has it coverage report a 100% test code 
		always qualifies to be safer than the non tested code 
	2.  Completion 
		The person can exhibit a closure on complete if test case passes 
		the person a job 
	3.  Robustness 
		the same function gets tested tested test and plust it robust because 
		the impact anlysis is now automated change in any location of code if 
		affects can be detected in a faster route 
	4.  Understanding 
		If a person first writes a test case obviously he understood what the customer 
		wants and writes test case on the given understanding which verified one 
		and hence his code follows the user function pattern 
		rather than he write code first and writes test cases on whatever wrong 
		code he has written 
	5.  Facts and Figures (Data Points)  (Reports 
		a) how time the build took to run all test case 1.1 
		b) how much time the build took to run 1.6 ---> 
		c) how many functions were introduced as test cases introduced 
			complexty % increase decrease 
		d)  how many uncovered lines 
		e) how many covered lines 
		f) how much time each method takes 
		g) failed , warned or any status 
		h)  no lines of code 
		i)   no of test cases 
		j)  visual coverage and graph (More ENahncers) 
	6.  Quatlity Guards 
		sonarqube 
		other coder  verifications tools that given suggestionf for leaks, security , 
		mishaps and others  in one go this possible only if you have good tools and 
		goo quality profile 



1.  i have to install  a package of type pytest 

	pip install pytest 
	pip install pytest-html 
	pip install pytest-cov 


2. how to write my python test case :- 
	actual value ---> by the code 
	expected value ---> by desire of function 
	then the actual value == expected value
